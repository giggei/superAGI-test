Steps for implementing the new entry functionality:
1. Create a form in the HTML file for users to enter the object data
2. Use JavaScript to capture the form data when the form is submitted
3. Send the form data to the backend using an AJAX request
4. In the Laravel backend, validate the data and store it in the SQLite database
5. Return a response to the front end indicating whether the operation was successful
