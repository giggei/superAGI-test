# SuperAGI Test

This repository contains a browser-based App that allows users to enter and store objects based on schema.org notation. The application uses HTML, Tailwind for CSS, and Javascript for the front end, and Laravel with authentication as backend with a SQLite database to store the objects that are entered. Only logged in users are able to create new entries.

## How to Use

1. Register or log in
2. Enter the object data in the provided form
3. Click 'Submit' to create a new entry

## Development

The outlines for implementing the new entry functionality and user authentication are located in the 'new_entry_implementation.txt' and 'user_authentication_implementation.txt' files respectively.
