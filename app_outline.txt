Outline for a browser-based App that allows users to enter and store objects based on schema.org notation. The application should use HTML, Tailwind for CSS, and Javascript for the front end, and Laravel with authentication as backend with a sqlite database to store the objects that are entered. Only logged in users should be able to create new entries.
